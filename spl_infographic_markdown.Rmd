### Introduction

I created a choropleth map to visualize the distribution of US publishing locations in the holdings of the [UWM Special Collections Library](http://uwm.edu/libraries/special/).  
  
I use a CSV file containing library metadata, US map data from the `maps` package, and `ggplot2` for visualization.

#### Set-up  
  
* `dplyr` for consistent data manipulation. 
* `ggplot2` for visualzation. 
* `maps` for map data and related functions. 

```{r packages, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(maps)
setwd('C:\\Users\\chapman4\\Downloads\\spl infographic')
```

### Library records
#### Loading library records

The library records are in CSV format. They were adapted from MARC records. 

```{r load.books}
books <- read.csv('spl.csv', header = TRUE, fileEncoding = 'UTF-8-BOM')
```  

```{r load.books.print, echo = FALSE}
knitr::kable(books[1:4, ], align = 'ccccc')
```

#### MARC location codes

The `place.code` is the only column needed for this visualization. It corresponds to the book's place of publishing, using the [MARC 21 Country Code Standard](https://www.loc.gov/marc/countries/countries_code.html).  

I need to translate the MARC country codes into their full names.  
  
The [MARC 21 Standards Website](https://www.loc.gov/marc/countries/countries_code.html) provides a clean list of country codes and their full names seperated by tabs. I copy it into a text file and read it in R as a dataframe.   

```{r place.codes}
place.codes <- read.csv('place_codes.txt', 
                        header = TRUE, 
                        sep = '\t', 
                        fileEncoding = 'UTF-8-BOM')
```
```{r place.codes.print, echo = FALSE}
knitr::kable(place.codes[1:4, ], align = 'cl')
```

#### Translating MARC Country Codes

I use `inner_join()` to merge the MARC country code dataframe with the library record dataframe along matching values in the `place.code` column.  
  
Non-matching rows from either dataframe are dropped.  

```{r join.place.names, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
books <- inner_join(books, place.codes, by = 'place.code') 

```
```{r join.place.names.print, echo = FALSE}
knitr::kable(books[1:4, ], align = 'lcccl')
```

#### State publishing totals



To sum up the number of library records published in each state, I use `dplyr`'s `count()`.  
  
`count()` reduces the dataframe to one row for each place.name value and adds a count of how many rows belong in each group.  
  
All other columns are dropped. 

```{r drop.non.place.names}
books <- count(books, place.name)
```

```{r drop.non.place.name.print, echo = FALSE}
knitr::kable(books[1:4, ], align = 'lc')
```

Note that these include non-US locations. I will remove them next. 

### Map data
#### US State map

The `maps` package contains a dataset of geographic coordinates for US states called `state`.  
  
The dataset needs to be formatted as a dataframe to comply with `ggplot2`.  
  
This is possible with `ggplot2`'s `map_data()`. 

```{r us.map}
us.map <- map_data('state')
```
```{r us.map.print, echo = FALSE}
knitr::kable(us.map[1:4, ], align = 'cccclc')
```


#### Adding publishing totals

I use  `inner_join()` to add the publishing location totals to each row of the map data based on state name. 

String formatting to ensure proper join: 

* State names need to be lowercase  


* Some state names have non-standard MARC titles ('New York (State)') that must be standardized. 

```{r join.lib.and.map, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
books <- books %>%
  mutate(place.name = recode(place.name, 
                             'New York (State)'   = 'New York',
                             'Washington (State)' = 'Washington'),
         place.name = tolower(place.name))

us.map <- inner_join(us.map, books, by = c('region' = 'place.name'))
```
```{r join.lib.and.map.print, echo = FALSE}
knitr::kable(us.map[1:4, ], align = 'l')
```

#### Annotation coordinates  
  
The map requires coordinates for the center of each state in order to situate the publishing totals as annotations. 

The `maps` package includes `state.center`, a list of coordinates for the center of each state. It also includes `state.name`, an alphabetical list of state names. The two lists are in the same order, so they can be combined as a dataframe.  
  
The state names are lowered to allow for joining with the map data. 

```{r annotation.coords}
annotation.coords <- data.frame(state.name, state.center) %>%
  mutate(state.name = tolower(state.name))
```

```{r annotation.coords.print, echo = FALSE}
knitr::kable(annotation.coords[1:4, ], align = 'lcc')
```

The `inner_join()` adds an `x` and `y` column to the map data that corresponds to the state's center. 

```{r join.map.with.coords}
us.map <- inner_join(us.map, annotation.coords, by = c('region' = 'state.name'))
```
```{r echo = FALSE}
knitr::kable(us.map[1:4, ], align = 'cc')
```

### Plotting
### Custom  theme

I create a custom `ggplot2` theme. It's a blank slate. 

```{r}
theme_bare <- theme(
  axis.line        = element_blank(),
  axis.text.x      = element_blank(),
  axis.text.y      = element_blank(),
  axis.ticks       = element_blank(),
  axis.title.x     = element_blank(),
  axis.title.y     = element_blank(),
  legend.text      = element_text(size = 7),
  legend.title     = element_text(size = 8),
  panel.background = element_blank(),
  panel.border     = element_blank())
```

### Plotting

Initializing the plot object and specifying the data source. 

```{r plot.1, eval = FALSE}
p <- ggplot(us.map)

```
***
  
Specifying the type of plot. `geom_polygon()` plots a series of shapes.  
  
* `long` and `lat` are the X and Y coordinates for the shapes  
  
* `group = group` tells `ggplot2` how many seperate shapes to plot. The map data `group` column contains one number for   each state.  
  
* `fill = log(n))` tells `ggplot2` how to color the inside of each shape. I use the publishing total from the library    records. I take the log of this number so that differences between all states are visible. Otherwise only a few        states dominate and the rest have no color.  
  
* `color = 'gray'` specifies the color of the state outlines.  
  
* `size = 0.1` specifies the size of the state outlines. 

```{r plot.2, eval = FALSE}
p + geom_polygon(aes(long, lat, 
                     group = group, 
                     fill  = log(n)),
                 color = 'gray', 
                 size  = 0.1) 
```
***
  
`scale_fill_gradient()` determines the range of colors that are used to fill the state shapes. It specifies a gradient rather than a set of discrete values.  
  
* `high` and `low` set the boundaries for the fill gradient.

```{r plot.3, eval = FALSE}
p + scale_fill_gradient(high = 'darkgreen', 
                        low  = 'seashell')
```
***
  
`coord_fixed()` is used to ensure that units of value are represented similarly on the X and Y axis. It may interfere with important map properties like projection. I'm not familar enough with maps to understand. 

```{r plot.4, eval = FALSE}
p + coord_fixed(1.3)
```
***
  
This adds a title to the plot. 

```{r plot.6, eval = FALSE}
p + ggtitle('UWM Special Collections Holdings By State')
```
***
  
This adds the annotations. The `ggplot2` `annotation()` function assumes that coordinates are provided by a seperate dataset. I use `with()` to circumvent this feature.  
  
* `geom = text` specifies the type of annotation object, which could be shapes, points, lines etc.  
  
* `x` and `y` are annotation coordinates (the state centers)  
  
* `label = n` chooses the values to display as annotation (the number of books published in each state)  
  
* `size = 3` sets the size of the annotations. It appears to be relative to the size of the window. 


```{r plot.7, eval = FALSE}
p + with(us.map, annotate(geom = 'text', x, y, label = n, size = 3))
```
***
  
Applying the custom blank theme from above.

```{r plot.8, eval = FALSE}
p + theme_bare
```
***
  
Removing the legend, because a log scale is not very useful in combination with the annotations. 

```{r plot.9, eval = FALSE}
p +  theme(legend.position = 'none')
```
***
  
The full `ggplot2` code: 

```{r plot.full}
ggplot(us.map) +
  geom_polygon(aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group, fill = log(n)),
               color = 'gray', size = 0.1) +
  ggtitle('UWM Special Collections Holdings By State') +
  scale_fill_gradient(high = 'darkgreen', low = 'seashell', guide = 'colorbar') +
  coord_fixed(1.3) +
  with(us.map, annotate(geom = 'text', x = x, y = y, label = n, size = 3)) +
  theme_bare +
  theme(legend.position = 'none')
```

### Conclusion

Improvements:  
  
* Annotations are cramped in some areas and could be shifted.  
  
* Where are Hawaii and Alaska?  
  
* A world map would be cool.
